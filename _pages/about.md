¡Hola! Hi! Olá! Hallo!

Welcome! I am Pedro Achanccaray, a peruvian researcher applying machine/deep learning models to remote sensing data. I have experience working on projects in the areas of agriculture, oil and gas, and building heritage preservation.

Currently, I am a researcher at the [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry - IGP](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp), [Technical University of Braunschweig - TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) working on [Building Heritage Preservation](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp/projects/spp2255-c3), and a lecturer in the [Deep Learning](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/igp/lehre/master/dl-rs) course.
