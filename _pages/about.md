¡Hola! Hi! Olá! Hallo!

Welcome! I am Pedro Achanccaray, a researcher applying machine/deep learning models to remote sensing data. I have experience working on projects in the areas of agriculture, oil and gas, and building heritage preservation.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry - IGP](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp) from the [Technical University of Braunschweig - TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) working on [Building Heritage Preservation](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp/projects/spp2255-c3) and as lecturer for the [Deep Learning](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/igp/lehre/master/dl-rs) course.


I got my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br/english/), Brazil in 2019 and 2014, respectively. I graduated in Mechanical & Electrical Engineering at [UNI](https://www.uni.edu.pe/), Peru in 2010.
