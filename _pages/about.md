Hi! I am a researcher applying machine/deep learning models to remote sensing data. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry - IGP](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp) from the [Technical University of Braunschweig - TU BS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) working on [Building Heritage Preservation](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp/projects/spp2255-c3) and as teaching assistant for the [Deep Learning](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/igp/lehre/master/dl-rs) course.

I got my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br/english/) in 2019 and 2014, respectively. I graduated in Mechanical & Electrical Engineering at [National University of Engineering - UNI](https://www.uni.edu.pe/) in 2010.
