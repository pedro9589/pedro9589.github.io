¡Hola! Hi! Olá! Hallo!

Welcome! I am Pedro Achanccaray Diaz, peruvian researcher proficient in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and remote sensing with expertise in applying these techniques to diverse fields such as agriculture mapping, oil and gas exploration/monitoring/extraction, and building heritage preservation.

Currently, I am working as researcher at the [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry - IGP](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp), [Technical University of Braunschweig - TUBS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/) working on [Building Heritage Preservation](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/igp/projects/spp2255-c3), and lecturer in the [Deep Learning](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/igp/lehre/master/dl-rs) course.
